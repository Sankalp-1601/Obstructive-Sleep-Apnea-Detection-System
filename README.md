# Project Title: Obstructive Sleep Apnea Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop an obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) prediction system using Machine Learning techniques. It assists in detecting whether a patient is suffering from obstructive sleep apnea based on input data.

## Features
- **Disease Information**: Users can search for information about Obstructive Sleep Apnea, including its definition, symptoms, and treatment options.
- **Diagnosis System**: Patients can input their basic information into the system to determine whether they are at risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnea.
- **Detection System**: Utilizing a trained Machine Learning model, the system predicts whether the user is likely to have Obstructive Sleep Apnea based on their input data.
- **Classification System**: After detection, the system calculates the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) and classifies the severity of OSA as Normal, Mild, Moderate, or Severe, providing appropriate recommendations.
- **Report Generation**: Upon successful detection and classification, users can download a detailed report summarizing their condition and recommended actions.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Personalized Recommendations**: Incorporate personalized recommendations based on the user's lifestyle, medical history, and other relevant factors to improve treatment adherence and effectiveness.
2. **Customized OSA Prediction**: Presently, OSA prediction models are based on data from the general population and may not take into account physiologic variations between individuals and other OSA-influencing variables. It might be possible to create tailored OSA prediction algorithms in the future that use patient-specific data to raise predictive accuracy.
3. **Continuous Updates**: The disease information section can be regularly updated with the latest research, treatment options, and preventive measures to provide users with the most up-to-date and accurate information.
4. **User Engagement**: Users can have the ability to ask questions, leave comments, or engage in discussions with healthcare professionals or other users to further enhance their understanding and knowledge sharing.
5. **Progress Tracking**: Users can have the option to track their test results over time and monitor their progress, enabling them to assess the effectiveness of preventive measures or treatment options.
6. **Endless Possibilities**: The future enhancements in this project can be endless.
